## DEA Cash System
One of the best ways to keep an engaging and active community running. This bot encourages chatting and helps form relationships between other users, bonding communities closer together.

The way this system works is quite simple, for every message that you send every 30 seconds that is at least 7 characters long, you will get $50.00.

If you are extra lucky, when sending messages you can win up to $10,000.00 in the lottery! The odds of winning the lottery are very low, but the more you chat, the higher chance you have of winning it!
